This is an pure objective-c (not Cocos2d) joystick implement.

There are three images.  
stick_base.png  
stick_normal.png  
stick_hold.png  

You can change them or add your new images for the joystick.

The size of the joystick in the demo is 128 * 128, so in the JoyStickView, I set the center point to (64, 64). 
  
If your joystick has a different size, please modify it.
